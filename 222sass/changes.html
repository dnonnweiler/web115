               <ol>
                   <li>Extremely Unfriendly to casual play, Corpse runs, XP loss, large time sinks</li>
                   <li>Much larger focus on social interaction, groups with multiple people were easy to come by, general community was positive and outgoing.</li>
                   <li>User Interface was very restrictive and clunky.</li>
                   <li>Characters were very weak, most classes could not kill a creature without assistance past level 15</li>
                   <li>Raid encounters were designed around throwing characters at dragons until one of them died.</li>
               </ol>
               </td>
               <td>
                   <ol>
                       <li>Much more casual friendly, death is not very punishing, a lot of content can be done within an hour</li>
                       <li>Fairly difficult to form a full group without someone playing multiple characters, community has become more cloistered</li>
                       <li>User Interface is much more streamlined and fully customizable</li>
                       <li>Characters are exceptionally more powerful at any given level, most classes can solo some content.</li>
                       <li>Raid Encounters are much more tactically impressive, requiring execution on participants part to complete.</li>
                   </ol>
               </td>
           </tr>  
       </table>
      <p>In conclusion, while many people who played Everquest back in 1999 yearn for the game that was back then, what I think they are really missing is the social interaction that took place, instead of the hardcore mechanics that have been replaced, the game is still a place where you can find this interaction, but it is a shadow of its former self, with real player face to face being few and far between.</p>
