<h1>Classic EQ</h1>

<p>Everquest is a MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game). It is considered by many to be the first True 3D online world, and the game that rocketed the MMO genera to the mainstream, spawning popular games like World of Warcraft</p>

<p>However Everquest at inception was not a game for a casual player, many objectives in the game, either obtaining equipment, gathering tradeskill materials or leveling, required many multiple hour sessions to achieve.</p>

<p>The largest time sink in Everquest turned out to be its extremely punishing death penalty, dying caused both a loss of equipment, and a loss of XP points, you could also lose levels from this. However these could be remedied by obtaining a ressurection spell from a cleric or Paladin, if no ressurection was available, you were looking at a long journey back from your spawn point, to retreive your equipment.</p>

<p>The things that had made Everquest punishing and difficult in the past have been, over time, relaxed, and its current iteration has many quality of life improvements to speed up gameplay.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll highlight some of the changes that have been made over the years.</p>
