       <h1>Modern Day Everquest</h1>
       <p>The fact that Everquest has survived for 18 years, through multiple changes of hands, from the original home at 989Studios, to Verant, to being the flagship product for Sony Online Entertainment and now, part of the packaged deal with Columbus Nova and being run by the renamed SOE as Daybreak Games. The fact that the game has continued to be profitable for this long, and maintain a playerbase, while still selling new content packs every year, speaks of the addictive quality of this platform.</p>
       <p>The vast majority of people who are currently playing everquest have been playing for over a decade and have put tenss of thousands of manhours into playing this game. </p>
       <p>Speaking with several of the current day players that are still full time into the game, approve of many of the quality of life changes, largest of, in their opinions, the instancing of raids and group content. Seconded by no longer needing to recover equipment from a corpse if you die, while the XP loss is still in place, it no longer has the bite it once did as several years back they included NPC cleric who would ressurect your corpse for a fee.</p>
       <p>The primary thing that people lament, is the loss of the social aspect of the game, many players find themselves alone when they play, and thus, do something termed "Multi-boxing" meaning they play more than one character at a time, as most content requires multiple characters to do.</p>
